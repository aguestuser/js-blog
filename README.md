# JS Blog

## Motivation

There are so many new things in JavaScript!

In this repo, I will make 2 side-by-side projects of a basic web stack using:

1. Koa.js and TypeOrm
2. Express.js and Sequelize

The former are the new kids on the block and use all sorts of yummy syntactical sugar. The latter are more "old school," but I suspect I might be able to handroll most of the syntactic sugar and benefit from the maturity and community support of the libraries.

To test that hypothesis (and see which stack I'd build a team around), I will build a basic blog app using both stacks.

## Specs

Each app will have:

* users, posts, comments, and (time permitting) social following
* full test coverage
* full TypeScript support
* full use of async/await (no callbacks allowed!)
* a conventional REST api
* a graphql api

## Evaluation Criteria

I will then evaluate on the following criteria:

* Expressiveness
* Developer "ergonomics"
* Performance
* Learnability for a diverse team
* Likelihood to increase velocity of a delivery team:
  * within a week
  * within a month
  * within six months

(and maybe a few more criteria as I get rolling)
